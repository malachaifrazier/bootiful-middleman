            Bootiful started as I wanted to have a beautiful, uncluttered, modern and evergreen Bootstrap template. Something not linked to any "niche" tool, that wouldn't force me to use images, icons, or colors I don't want; and easy to extend or push in one direction or one another.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Something all the classics already embedded : FAQ, Pricing, admin, profile page, landing page, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Something close to what could be "a default Bootstrap template" or "a raw Bootstrap template" or "a bare Bootstrap template".
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            After hours, if not days, of googling around, I decided to stop the search. I could hardly believe that nobody needs a simple, default Bootstrap theme, despite the fact that Bootstrap is the most used (S)CSS framework of the world.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            So far, the closest available tool is simply the "examples" page of the official Bootstrap website :  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples</a>
          </p>
          <p class="p-0 m0-4"  class="mt-3">
              These examples stick to the official Bootstrap classes (of course), but 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>They are not enough</li>
            <li>They completely lack of personality</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Maybe this "empty design" or "lack of personality" actually <em>is</em> the essence of Bootstrap : the ability to be transformed into anything <em>relevant for the business</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            But what if you want to start your business today ? Would wait for weeks for a simple admin page ? A blog ? Maybe the best is to start with a decent enough template, close to the Bootstrap standard, that will always be able to be updated to the latest available version of Bootstrap.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            This is why I built Bootiful : a kind of "default" Bootstrap theme for webapps. That gives you the ability to have a landing page without complicated icons, color set, or bloated html blocks. That gives you a decent admin panel, a good-looking user profile page, a distraction-free blog, and so on. The basics, made correctly for a first launch.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            The project is completly free and open-source, so feel free to contribute, criticize, or add pages.
